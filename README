-------Implementation-------

The seqnum are actually set in non-modulo forms, for example the 32th packet has seqnum 32 in
program. However, in logs they are recorded in modulo form, for example the 32th packet is recorded
with seqnum 32 % 32 = 0.

Set DEBUG = 1 in sender.py and receiver.py to print debug messages


-------How to run--------

Run emulator first:
./nEmulator.sh <emu receive port forward> <receiver address> <receiver's receive port> <emu receive port backward> <sender address> <sender's receive port> <max delay in ms> <discard prob> <verbose mode>

Then run receiver:
./receiver.sh <emulator hostname> <emu receive port backward> <receiver's receive port> <name of file write to>

Last run sender:
./sender.sh <emulator hostname> <emu receive port forward> <sender's receive port> <timeout in ms> <input file>


-------Testing--------
